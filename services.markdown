* For practical examples, see [this repository](https://github.com/rajivsam/descriptive_analytics/). *Effectively framing a business challenge as a data science problem requires experience, careful analysis, and close collaboration. Automated or "cookbook" approaches often fall short, leading to models that are difficult to interpret or deploy in production. I can partner with your team to guide the initial iterations of your machine learning or optimization initiatives—helping you identify the most relevant data sources, select suitable modeling techniques, and ensure that results are both interpretable and actionable. This approach increases the likelihood of building solutions that deliver real business value and are ready for operational use.*
