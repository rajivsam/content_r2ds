_Done correctly_ , data science solutions developed for enterprise applications can have a _rinse and repeat_ nature. The _rinse and repeat_ phrase implies that the solution recipe to develop the next version of the solution, for example for the next business time period, is going to be similar. The challenge lies in getting to a version of a solution that has this _rinse and repeat_ nature. The fact that getting that first model out is very challenging is consistent with results from surveys such as this from <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2022/01/models-rarely-deployed-industrywide-failure-machine-learning-leadership.html"> kd-nuggets</a>.

Understanding the following:
* the outcomes you desire,
* the quality of your data assets in relation to the outcomes you desire,
* other technical constraints that are related to the solution you want to develop, and,
* your budget and schedule constraints,

requires experience, skills, and engineering judgment.

Data science can lead to actionable insights and understanding of your business or organizational data. Analytics and machine learning solutions can be integrated with your existing or new IT applications to enhance their impact. If you are looking for data science help with your project, start a <a href="https://calendly.com/rajiv-sambasivan/30min"> conversation </a> with me today to explore how a <em> rinse and repeat </em> solution can be developed for your idea. I am a <a href="https://rajivsam.github.io/"> seasoned data scientist</a> looking for remote consulting data science projects. The [overview section]({%link about.markdown %}) of this website describes a proposed template for working with me to get your data science idea to fruition. The process is incremental and viability or incompatibility can be identified very quickly. The quality of open-source data science and online collaboration tools available today make remote work a plausible model for the right match. If this resonates with you, and you are looking for data science expertise to get your data-driven idea to change the world, I would appreciate a chat with you to discuss how I can help you with your project.
