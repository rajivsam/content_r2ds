Breaking down functional (business) tasks into known data science task primitives needs to be done as part of developing the data science solution. There are a handfull of data science task primitives (see {%cite provost2013data %} for details), so this might seem like a simple task. Though old, {%cite pyle1999data %} provides timeless advice and a very good summary of the tasks involved in a typical data science business project. Typically, there is a significant exploratory component in developing a data science model requiring dialogue with business stakeholders and modelling experimentation. To get success, the data science team must surface the right questions and model the right problem. This takes skill, exprience and engineering judgement. The following quote from {%cite provost2013data %} best summarizes this:

> A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data- analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known task for which tools are available. Recognizing familiar problems and their solutions avoids wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel. It also allows people to focus attention on more interesting parts of the process that require human involvement—parts that have not been automated, so human creativity and intelligence must come in‐ to play.

Start a <a href="https://calendly.com/rajiv-sambasivan/30min"> conversation </a> with me today to explore getting your data science based business idea to fruition. The [process section]({%link process.markdown %}) provides the details of the process I would follow to develop an understanding of your problem. Some representative services I provide are:

1. Statistical Modelling and Data Analysis in support of case studies relevant to your application domain. For example, this could answer a specific question about a cohort of users in your application. For example, are users from group A more profitable than users from group B?
2. Knowldege Base construction using data mining and information extraction techniques. Knowledge bases created this way can be used by your applications to serve your customers, users and employees better.
3. Modelling and Data Analysis in support of application development for process automation or decision support. While a case study answers a specific set of questions, the product from this task is a model that is used in business operations. An application that dispatches tasks to an automatic workflow or to a human expert for further triaging is an example of a process automation task that can be accomplished with machine learning. An application to reject or approve an employee request for a particular resource is an example of a decision theoretic application.
4. Machine Learning model development on streaming data
5. Model development for Big Data 
6. Development of models based on combinatorial optimization
