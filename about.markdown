At the surface level, developing a data science solution for a business task is about breaking the functional task into known data science task primitives. There are a handful of data science task primitives (see {%cite provost2013data %} for details), so this might seem like a simple task. Usually, a naive approach leads to uncovering hidden problems and pitfalls due to unverified modelling assumptions and sub-optimal models that are costly to develop and maintain. Though old, {%cite pyle1999data %} provides timeless advice and a very good summary of the tasks involved in a typical data science business project. Typically, there is a significant exploratory component in developing a data science model requiring dialogue with business stakeholders and modeling experimentation. To achieve success, the data science team must surface the right questions and model the right problem. This takes skill, experience and engineering judgment. The following quote from {%cite provost2013data %} best summarizes this:

> A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data- analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known task for which tools are available. Recognizing familiar problems and their solutions avoids wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel. It also allows people to focus attention on more interesting parts of the process that require human involvement—parts that have not been automated, so human creativity and intelligence must come in‐ to play.
