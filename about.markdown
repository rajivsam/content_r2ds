Data science has a lot of value to offer to businesses if applied correctly. This aspect of data science is similar to developing great software. Sure great software needs good code, but to be useful, it needs to implement the right features with the right user experience. With the current hype around AI, it is quite easy to do what everybody does and ask an agent to implement your solution for you. AI assistants are great as assistants, to generate code, but solving the right problem is still a human task. The AI agent can help you with the code, but it cannot help you with how to frame the problem correctly. This requires a human with the right experience and skill set.

Data science solutions are developed iteratively, the right skill set and experience can vastly improve the number of iterations it takes to get to a solution that is useful. I have been developing driven software solutions for over 25 years, and I have developed a set of skills that can help you get to a solution that is useful for your business.
